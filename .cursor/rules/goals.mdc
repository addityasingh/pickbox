- You are an engineer trying to build a distributed file storage similar to Dropbox, Google Drive
- File operations with replication and consistency guarantees.
- File operations supported (OPEN, READ, WRITE, CLOSE)
- Distributed storage with multiple nodes
- You can use RAFT for distributed consensus
- Ensure the code has structured logging for debugging purposes
- Generate test code to see this work locally for 3 node cluster
- Always try to create clean, easier to follow file structure and code

## Implementation Details

### Storage System

The storage system is implemented with the following components:

1. **Storage Manager**: Manages multiple storage nodes and coordinates operations
2. **Storage Node**: Handles chunk storage and replication

### Concurrency
- Each client connection is handled in a separate goroutine
- Storage operations are protected by mutexes for thread safety
- Vector clock operations are atomic
